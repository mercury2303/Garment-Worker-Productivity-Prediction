# Garment-Worker-Productivity-Prediction


1. INTRODUCTION:  
This project was based on HubbleMind’s Machine Learning internship where I created a machine 
learning model to predict productivity in garment workers. Various operational factors were 
involved to develop a comprehensive model where the focus was on improving allocation of 
resources in manufacturing environments by relying on accurately predicting productivity of 
workers participating in the garment industry.  

2. Analysing the Dataset and Discovering Features:  
The dataset used for this project is the Garment Worker Productivity Dataset from the UCI Machine 
Learning Repository. It contains information about garment production processes, covering 14 
features and 1,197 data rows.  
Features:  
date: The date of the record. 
quarter: The quarter of the year (Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4) 
department: worker’s area of expertise ( sewing or finishing). 
team: Team number. 
targeted_productivity: Target productivity (between 0 and 1). 
smv: Standard Minute Value (time required to complete the task). 
wip: Work in Progress. 
over_time: Overtime done (minutes) 
incentive: benefits provided to garment workers. 
idle_time: how long they sat idle 
idle_men: workers who were sitting idle for a certain period of time. 
no_of_style_change: Number of style changes in production of garment. 
no_of_workers: Number of workers in the whole team. 
actual_productivity: The target variable representing productivity achieved (between 0 and 1) 
OBJECTIVE: To predict the actual productivity of a team based on above features.
